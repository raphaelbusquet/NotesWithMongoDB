# NotesWithMongoDB

## I really liked this FullStack project where I use many technologies together.

### Made with love and: MongoDB, Express, handlebars, nodemon and Bootstrap. I hope you guys enjoy it!! 

#### I used CRUD strategies to create, read, update and delete notes.
Connected with MongoDB Atlas cloud database.
I used template as handelbars to render the views, Bootstrap to styling and, off course, a lot of javascript (nodeJS) <3
